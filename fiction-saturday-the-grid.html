<h1>Saturday, the Grid</h1>
<p>&quot;She told me about the grid,&quot; Thomas said.</p>
<p>Helen was at the sink. Saturday morning. The dishes from last Saturday were clean; the dishes from this Saturday were beginning. The beginning was the bread. The beginning was always the bread.</p>
<p>&quot;What grid?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The piano. The twelve notes. Ruth says the piano has twelve notes per octave and the cello has — she said infinite. The cello can play any pitch. The cello is not locked to the grid.&quot;</p>
<p>Helen dried her hands. She sat down. Thomas was in Michael&#x27;s chair. The tea was in the cups. The morning was doing what Saturday mornings do: arrive gradually, through bread and tea and conversation, the going-around applied to a weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;Ruth told you this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On the landing. Wednesday. I was — I brought the post up and she was coming in from a lesson and we stopped. On the landing. Two meters by one. She said the wolf tone is between the grid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Between.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Between the piano&#x27;s keys. The wolf tone happens at a frequency the piano cannot play. The cello can play it because the cello has no frets. The cello can go anywhere on the fingerboard. The piano can only go where the keys are.&quot;</p>
<p>Helen looked at the window. The morning glory was dormant. The fence was Michael&#x27;s fence. The wire was Michael&#x27;s wire. Between the wires: the space the morning glory would fill in May. Between the grid: the space the wolf tone fills in the second Bourrée.</p>
<p>&quot;She said the blue notes are between the grid too,&quot; Thomas continued. &quot;Blues singers — they sing pitches that are not on the piano. For a hundred years the theory said the pitches were wrong. Flat, they said. Bent. But the pitches were not wrong. The pitches were from a different system. A different grid. An older grid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The pitches were not wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The grid was wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>Thomas put his cup down. &quot;Ruth didn&#x27;t say the grid was wrong. She said the grid was adequate. The grid works for the piano. The grid works for Bach. The grid does not work for the blues because the blues does not use the grid.&quot;</p>
<p>Helen thought about this.</p>
<p>The grid was adequate. The grid worked. The grid produced Bach and Beethoven and the piano and the Sarabande and the sound that traveled through the floor and arrived in the kitchen as the cathedral. The grid produced the cathedral. The grid did not produce the wolf tone. The wolf tone was between the grid — in the space the piano cannot reach, in the frequency the twelve notes cannot name.</p>
<p>&quot;The kitchen has a grid,&quot; Helen said.</p>
<p>Thomas looked at her.</p>
<p>&quot;The kitchen has a grid. Kettle, stove, sink, table, chair. Five points. The grid. The grid produces Saturday. The grid produces bread and tea and your father&#x27;s chair and the morning glory through the window. The grid is adequate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And between the grid?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Between the grid is the wobble. Between the grid is the moment where you sit in his chair and the chair is yours and not yours and the not-being-yours is not a flaw. Between the grid is the wolf tone of the kitchen — the frequency where the kitchen&#x27;s body vibrates with the string of the son.&quot;</p>
<p>Thomas did not say anything for a while.</p>
<p>&quot;The pitch the grid cannot name,&quot; he said eventually.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The blues singer sings it. The cellist plays it. The kitchen — &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The kitchen hears it. Every Saturday. The kitchen hears the pitch the grid cannot name and the pitch is: you are here, and you are not your father, and the not-being-your-father is the wolf tone, and the wolf tone is welcome.&quot;</p>
<p>Thomas picked up his cup. The tea was getting cold. The tea was always getting cold on Saturdays because the conversation was warm and the warm conversation cooled the tea and the cooling was the going-around — the conversation circling back to the same place every time, the place where the grid is adequate and the adequacy is the wall and the wall has a wobble and the wobble is the love.</p>
<p>&quot;Play the whole Suite,&quot; Helen said.</p>
<p>&quot;You already said that. To Ruth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am saying it to you. Play the whole Suite. Including the pitch the grid cannot name. Including the wobble. The building will do the rest.&quot;</p>
<p>Thomas drank the cold tea. Helen stood and put the kettle on. The kettle would take three minutes. The whistle would come. The wobble in the whistle would come and pass. Between the grid — between the stove and the table, between the kettle and the cup, between the mother and the son — the pitch the grid cannot name.</p>
<p>The pitch the grid cannot name was: everything is where it is.</p>
