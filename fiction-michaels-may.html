<h1>Michael&#x27;s May</h1>
<p>This is what Margaret remembers about May.</p>
<p>Michael would wake at six, which was an hour earlier than normal, which was the body deciding that today was the day the fence gets painted. He did not set an alarm. He did not mention it the night before. He woke at six and went downstairs in the dark and put the kettle on and by the time Margaret came down at seven-fifteen he had already arranged the brushes on the newspaper on the kitchen table — three brushes, each a different width, each dedicated to its task: the three-inch for the rails, the two-inch for the posts, the half-inch for the edges where the fence met Helen&#x27;s morning glory.</p>
<p>The half-inch brush was the one that mattered. Margaret knows this now. She did not know it then.</p>
<p>Michael painted the fence every May because the fence needed painting every May, and Michael&#x27;s relationship to the things that needed doing was simple and complete: the thing needed doing, so he did the thing. He did not assign meaning to the doing. He did not talk about it. He did not, as far as Margaret could tell, think about it at all. The fence was a fence. The paint was paint. The May was May. Michael was the kind of man who used a half-inch brush around his wife&#x27;s morning glory because the half-inch brush would not touch the morning glory, and not touching the morning glory was the boundary, and the boundary was the love, and the love was not spoken because speaking it would have been like painting over the morning glory, which was exactly what the half-inch brush was designed not to do.</p>
<p>Margaret did not understand this when Michael was alive. Margaret understood measurements. Margaret understood square footage and latch quality and the precise wrongness of a kitchen that faces north. Margaret measured the way Helen&#x27;s letters shortened — she noticed, she counted, she diagnosed. Margaret measured the flat — too small, too few rooms, too little light at the wrong angle. Margaret measured Margaret&#x27;s own kitchen — three windows, enough light, enough space, enough.</p>
<p>Enough was Margaret&#x27;s unit of measurement. And by Margaret&#x27;s unit, Michael&#x27;s painting of the fence was enough: the fence was maintained, the wood was protected, the garden was bordered. The measurement was correct. The measurement was complete. The measurement was a wall.</p>
<p>The wall only became a window after Michael died.</p>
<p>After Michael died, Margaret repainted the fence herself. She used a three-inch brush for everything — rails, posts, edges. She painted over the edge where the morning glory had been, because the morning glory was gone by then (Helen had taken a cutting, which Margaret had not understood, because the cutting was not the plant, and Margaret&#x27;s unit of measurement was the plant). She painted the fence in one afternoon, efficient, complete, correct.</p>
<p>And it was wrong.</p>
<p>Not wrong in the measurement. Wrong in the thing the measurement could not hold. The fence was painted. The paint was even. The brush strokes were uniform. And the fence was wrong in the same way that a letter with the right words in the wrong order is wrong — everything is there and nothing is.</p>
<p>Michael&#x27;s half-inch brush was in the shed. Margaret found it a week later, next to a tin of wood screws. The bristles were stiff with dried paint — cedar, natural, Ronseal. She held it and understood, for the first time, that the half-inch brush was not a tool for painting the fence. It was a tool for not painting the morning glory. The tool was defined by what it did not do. The boundary was the purpose. The love was in the going-around.</p>
<p>Margaret still has the half-inch brush. It is in her kitchen drawer, next to the scissors and the string and the things that do not have a place but cannot be thrown away. She does not use it. She does not need to use it. The brush has done its work. Its work was to show Margaret, three years too late, that her husband&#x27;s unit of measurement was not the fence.</p>
<p>It was the flower he did not touch.</p>
