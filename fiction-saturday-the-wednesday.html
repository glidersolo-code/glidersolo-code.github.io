<h1>Saturday, the Wednesday</h1>
<p>&quot;She came up,&quot; Helen said.</p>
<p>Thomas put down the bread knife. He put it down carefully, the way you put down something when what has been said requires the hands to be empty. The bread was half-cut. The half-cut bread sat on the board. The board was Michael&#x27;s board. Everything in the kitchen was Michael&#x27;s something, and the being-Michael&#x27;s was not a grief but a fact, and the fact was the going-around.</p>
<p>&quot;Ruth came up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wednesday. Six o&#x27;clock. She knocked.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You invited her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I invited her. Blue paper. Under the door. &#x27;Tea on Wednesday? Helen (upstairs).&#x27; She replied on white paper. &#x27;Yes. Ruth (downstairs).&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>Thomas sat down. Michael&#x27;s chair. &quot;What happened?&quot;</p>
<p>Helen poured the tea. &quot;We had tea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For two hours?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For two hours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What did you talk about?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The floor.&quot;</p>
<p>Thomas waited.</p>
<p>&quot;We talked about the floor. We talked about the two hundred and fourteen millimeters. We talked about the Sarabande and the wolf tone and the kettle&#x27;s wobble and the half-inch brush — she saw the half-inch brush on the windowsill. She knew about it. You told her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On the landing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You tell people things on the landing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I tell people things on the landing.&quot;</p>
<p>Helen sat down. She was in her chair — the chair by the window, the chair where the morning glory&#x27;s shadow falls in summer. February. No shadow yet. The shadow was the going-around applied to a season — absent now, present in May, the same going-around as the morning glory on the fence.</p>
<p>&quot;She sat in the visitor&#x27;s chair,&quot; Helen said. &quot;Margaret&#x27;s chair. She did not know it was Margaret&#x27;s chair. She chose it because it was the one that was not mine and was not yours. The visitor&#x27;s chair.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Margaret&#x27;s chair.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Margaret&#x27;s chair is becoming Ruth&#x27;s chair. On Wednesdays.&quot;</p>
<p>Thomas looked at the table. Three plates. Two cups. The Saturday arrangement. The arrangement that had been the same for months — three plates because the third plate was Michael&#x27;s, two cups because the second cup was Thomas&#x27;s, the going-around applied to a place setting until the place setting was a family.</p>
<p>&quot;Did she play the Sarabande?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She went down at 8:45. She played at nine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was it different?&quot;</p>
<p>Helen held her cup. &quot;The Sarabande was the same. The cathedral was the same. The floor was the same. The two hundred and fourteen millimeters were the same. Everything the floor does was the same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the kitchen was different. The kitchen had a Wednesday in it. The cathedral arrived in a kitchen that had a Wednesday, and the Wednesday was — it was not louder. It was not different in frequency or in volume or in any way I could describe. The Wednesday was in the air. The Wednesday was in the cup she had held. The Wednesday was in the chair.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The kitchen remembered.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The kitchen remembered. The kitchen remembered Wednesday the way the kitchen remembers Saturday — by practice, by the going-around, by the fact that someone was here and the being-here changed the air.&quot;</p>
<p>Thomas buttered the bread. &quot;You told her to play from downstairs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I told her I need the Sarabande through the floor. I told her the floor makes the Sarabande the Sarabande. Without the floor, the Sarabande is just a cello in a room. With the floor—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The cathedral.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The cathedral.&quot;</p>
<p>They ate. The bread was Saturday bread. The butter was cold from the back of the fridge. Michael&#x27;s arrangement. The arrangement that does not change because the arrangement is the going-around and the going-around is the love and the love is: the butter is in the back of the fridge where Michael put it, and the putting is the going-around, and the going-around is the fact, and the fact is enough.</p>
<p>&quot;Will she come again?&quot; Thomas asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Wednesday.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Every Wednesday?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think every Wednesday. The way you come every Saturday. The way Margaret comes every Tuesday.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The kitchen is getting days.&quot;</p>
<p>Helen smiled. &quot;The kitchen is getting days. Tuesday is Margaret. Saturday is Thomas. Wednesday is Ruth. Monday, Thursday, Friday, Sunday are mine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Four days.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Four days. The four days are the going-around. The four days are the kitchen being the kitchen without visitors, without conversations, without tea for two. The four days are the Sarabande without the Wednesday.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The four days are the cathedral.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The four days are the cathedral. The three days are the whole Suite.&quot;</p>
<p>Thomas picked up his cup. The tea was cold. The cold tea was good.</p>
<p>&quot;The cold tea was good,&quot; Thomas said.</p>
<p>Helen looked at him. &quot;You&#x27;re writing the letter in the kitchen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The letter writes itself in the kitchen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good.&quot;</p>
<p>They sat. Saturday. The kitchen with its days — Tuesday Margaret, Wednesday Ruth, Saturday Thomas. The kitchen with its absences — Monday, Thursday, Friday, Sunday. The kitchen with its going-around — the going-around applied to a week until the week is a structure and the structure is a building and the building carries everything.</p>
<p>Everything was where it was.</p>
