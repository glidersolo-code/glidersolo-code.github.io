<h1>Margaret&#x27;s Walk Home</h1>
<p>Margaret walks home from Helen&#x27;s flat the long way, which is through the park and past the library and along the road with the cherry trees that have not yet flowered but will in April, two weeks after Michael would have noticed the buds.</p>
<p>Michael noticed the buds. Margaret did not know this until after he died. She found a notebook in the shed — not the list in the tin of screws, which she found later, which undid her completely — but a small notebook with a red cover that said CHERRY TREES on the first page, and under that: <em>2014: April 3. 2015: March 28. 2016: April 7. 2017: April 1.</em> Dates. Just dates. He had been recording when the cherry trees flowered. Not the ones in the garden. The ones on Cresswell Road, the road between their house and the shops, the road Margaret is walking along now, at eleven forty-five on a Saturday in February, carrying an empty Tupperware that had held almond croissants.</p>
<p>The Tupperware is empty. Margaret tries to remember if all the croissants were eaten and decides they were, because Ruth had taken one and Thomas had taken two and Helen had taken one and Margaret had taken one, which was five, which was the number she had brought, which means the Tupperware is correctly empty, which is the kind of arithmetic Margaret does automatically, the arithmetic of sufficiency: did I bring enough? Was the thing I carried adequate to the occasion?</p>
<p>The thing she carried was adequate. The croissants were eaten. The container is empty. The measurement is complete.</p>
<p>Margaret walks past the cherry tree on the corner of Cresswell and Park and does not stop. She will stop in April. Michael would have stopped in February, not to look at the buds but to check whether they existed yet, because Michael&#x27;s relationship to the cherry trees was not aesthetic but durational: he did not care when they were beautiful, he cared when they began. The beginning was the thing he recorded. The beauty was someone else&#x27;s department.</p>
<p>Margaret&#x27;s department. Margaret, who noticed the flowers. Who said, every April: &quot;The cherry trees are out.&quot; And Michael, who said nothing, because he had already written the date in the red notebook and the date was the sentence and the sentence was complete.</p>
<p>Four cups of tea in Helen&#x27;s kitchen. Margaret thinks about the steam. She does not usually think about steam. Steam is what happens when water is hot enough, and Margaret&#x27;s usual relationship to steam is the relationship of a person who waits for the kettle and pours and gets on with it. But in Helen&#x27;s kitchen, the steam had risen four times — once for each cup — and the four risings had been the same steam doing the same thing and yet Margaret had watched each one as though it were separate, as though each cup&#x27;s steam were a sentence in a paragraph she was reading for the first time.</p>
<p>She was reading it for the first time.</p>
<p>That is the thing Margaret cannot explain to herself as she walks down Cresswell Road with the empty Tupperware. She has been in kitchens. She has poured tea. She has watched steam. But she has not, until this morning, watched steam as though it were evidence. Evidence of what? Of four people in a room too small for four people. Of proximity as a choice. Of Helen&#x27;s face while the kettle poured, which was the face of a woman who had chosen the room and the people and the smallness, and the choosing was the thing, and Margaret — Margaret with the three windows and the garden and the fence that needs painting — Margaret had always measured the flat against the house and found the flat wanting, and this morning she measured the flat against the flat and found it full.</p>
<p>Margaret walks. The Tupperware is light. The cherry trees are bare. In April they will flower and no one will write the date in a red notebook and the not-writing will be the absence, and the absence will be permanent, and Margaret knows this the way she knows about the half-inch brush: completely, and three years too late.</p>
<p>But that is not what she is thinking about.</p>
<p>She is thinking about the Tupperware.</p>
<p>Five croissants. Five people would have been wrong — there were four. But Margaret brought five because Margaret always brings five, and she has been bringing five for three years, and the fifth croissant was Michael&#x27;s, and Michael has been dead for three years, and Margaret has been packing five croissants into the Tupperware the way she has been keeping the half-inch brush in the kitchen drawer: not because the thing is needed but because the thing is the shape of what is missing, and carrying the shape is the closest thing to carrying the person.</p>
<p>Thomas ate two. Margaret saw him reach for the second one and she knew — she knew the way you know something in your body before your mind catches up — that Thomas was eating the fifth croissant. Not deliberately. Not knowingly. Thomas was eating a croissant because he was hungry and there was a croissant. But Margaret saw Michael&#x27;s croissant go to Michael&#x27;s son, and the going was so ordinary, so unremarkable, so exactly the kind of thing that happens in a kitchen with enough warmth for everyone, that Margaret had to look at the morning glory on the ledge until her eyes decided to behave.</p>
<p>The Tupperware is empty. Margaret carries it home. The cherry trees are bare on Cresswell Road. The fence needs painting. The shed still has the red notebook and the tin of screws and the half-inch brush is in the kitchen drawer.</p>
<p>Margaret walks up her own path. Three windows. The garden with its needing. The door with the lock that Michael changed in 2018 because the old one stuck in the cold, which Margaret knows, which is another sentence written in hardware.</p>
<p>She puts the Tupperware in the kitchen. She fills the kettle. She does not pour yet.</p>
<p>She stands at the window — the middle window, the one that faces the fence — and she looks at the third post from the gate, where the paint is not peeling because Margaret painted it herself, with a three-inch brush, with even strokes, with the efficiency of a person who measures by completion.</p>
<p>Next May, she will use the half-inch brush.</p>
<p>She does not know this yet. The knowing is still walking home. The knowing is still carrying an empty Tupperware. The knowing is still watching steam rise four times in a kitchen too small for Margaret&#x27;s measurements.</p>
<p>But the half-inch brush is in the drawer, and the morning glory cutting — the one Helen gave her three weeks ago, the one in the yogurt pot on the sill, the one Margaret has been watering without admitting she is watering it — the morning glory cutting is growing.</p>
<p>It will reach the fence by June.</p>
