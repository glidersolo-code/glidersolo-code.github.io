<h1>Chen, the Broadening</h1>
<p>Dae-jung asked the question that changed the project.</p>
<p>They were eating lunch. Maren had been describing her latest reading — the little red dots, the virial estimator, the cocoon — and Dae-jung, who listened to Maren&#x27;s paragraph reports the way a spouse listens to weather updates from a place they have never visited, said: &quot;So you think you&#x27;ve been measuring wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not measuring wrong. Inferring wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s the difference?&quot;</p>
<p>Maren set down her fork. &quot;When I measure the paragraph, the measurements are accurate. The sentence lengths are correct. The word frequencies are correct. The rhythm is correct. I&#x27;ve mapped all of this. None of it is wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the conclusions are wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The conclusions might be wrong. The measurements connect to the conclusions through a model. The model assumes something about how the measurements were produced. If the assumption is wrong, the conclusion is wrong even though the measurement is right.&quot;</p>
<p>Dae-jung looked at her the way he looked at her when she was about to say the thing that would keep her awake until 2 AM.</p>
<p>&quot;The virial estimator,&quot; Maren said, &quot;measures the width of a spectral line and concludes: massive black hole. But the width was caused by electron scattering, not by orbital velocity. The line looked the same either way. The measurement was identical. The cause was different. The tool assumed one cause and inferred a mass that was a hundred times too large.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the paragraph?&quot;</p>
<p>This was the question. Maren had been circling it since she read the paper. She had mapped the paragraph&#x27;s properties exhaustively: density, rhythm, image frequency, syntactic complexity, the ratio of concrete nouns to abstractions, the distribution of pauses. She had fed these measurements into her critical framework — the interpretive tool she had built across ten months of reading — and the framework had returned conclusions. The paragraph was about loss. The paragraph was about constraint. The paragraph was about the distance between what can be said and what is meant.</p>
<p>These conclusions felt true. They had the heft and internal consistency of well-calibrated virial estimates. But the framework, like the estimator, contained an assumption about how the measurements were produced. The assumption was: the density of the paragraph is caused by the depth of its subject. Dense prose implies deep thought. Complex syntax implies complex meaning. The broader the line, the more massive the black hole.</p>
<p>What if the density was caused by scattering?</p>
<p>Maren had noticed, early in her reading, that Chen&#x27;s sentences changed depending on what she had read immediately before. A sentence encountered after a simple passage felt straightforward. The same sentence encountered after a dense passage felt impenetrably compressed. She had attributed this to context effects — the reader&#x27;s eye adjusting to local conditions. But the little red dots suggested a different model. What if the density was not a property of the sentence but a property of the medium the sentence passed through? What if Chen&#x27;s paragraph, like the little red dots, was wrapped in a cocoon — a medium made from the reader&#x27;s accumulated interpretive history — and the density Maren measured was not the paragraph&#x27;s intrinsic signal but the broadened profile produced by scattering through that medium?</p>
<p>If so, then the paragraph&#x27;s intrinsic signal was narrow. Small. Compact. The thing Chen was actually saying might be modest — a single observation, a contained image, a remark no denser than a remark about the weather. The density that Maren had spent ten months analyzing — the mass she had computed from the line widths of Chen&#x27;s prose — was produced not by the paragraph but by the thickness of the cocoon Maren had grown around it.</p>
<p>The cocoon was her own reading. Every pass through the paragraph deposited another layer of ionized interpretation. Every cross-reference, every note, every midnight re-reading added density to the medium. By the thirty-eighth reading, the cocoon was Compton-thick. Nothing from the paragraph reached Maren unscattered. The intrinsic signal — the narrow core of what Chen actually meant — was buried inside a broad profile generated by the medium of Maren&#x27;s own critical apparatus.</p>
<p>&quot;I think,&quot; Maren said to Dae-jung, &quot;that I&#x27;ve been measuring the cocoon and calling it the paragraph.&quot;</p>
<p>Dae-jung ate a piece of bread. &quot;Can you see through the cocoon?&quot;</p>
<p>Rusakov and Watson had seen through the cocoon by using the highest-resolution spectra available — instruments sensitive enough to resolve the narrow intrinsic cores inside the broad scattered profiles. The narrow cores were there. They had always been there. But lower-resolution observations smoothed them out. The cocoon was visible only as breadth. The source was visible only at the highest resolution.</p>
<p>Maren did not have a higher-resolution instrument. She had one instrument: her reading. And her reading was the cocoon. The instrument and the obscuring medium were the same thing. To resolve the intrinsic signal, she would need to read with a sensitivity that distinguished Chen&#x27;s prose from her own accumulated interpretation of it — to separate the photon from the scattering events it had undergone. She did not know if this was possible. The scattering was not a distortion applied to the paragraph from outside. It was the history of reading itself, deposited as opacity, growing denser with every encounter.</p>
<p>She opened the manuscript. She read the first sentence. She tried to see only the width of the sentence itself — its intrinsic emission — without the broadening of everything she had already said about it. The sentence was short. Seven words. It might be small. It might be narrow. The mass she had computed for it might be a hundred times too large.</p>
<p>She did not know yet. The cocoon was still there. But she had named it, and naming the cocoon was the first step toward distinguishing it from the source.</p>
