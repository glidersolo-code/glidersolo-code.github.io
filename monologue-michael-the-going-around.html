<h1>Michael, the Going-Around</h1>
<p>I painted around the morning glory because you do not paint through a morning glory.</p>
<p>This is not a philosophy. This is not a metaphor. This is paint. You paint the fence. The fence has a morning glory on it. The morning glory is in the way if you are painting the fence, or the morning glory is in its place if you are painting around the morning glory, and I was always painting around the morning glory, which is why the fence took two weekends instead of one, which is why Helen said <em>the fence is still not finished</em> and I said <em>the fence is finished around the morning glory</em> and she said <em>Michael</em> and the way she said <em>Michael</em> was the whole conversation.</p>
<p>The half-inch brush was for the going-around. The four-inch was for the rails. The four-inch is fast. The four-inch does not think. The half-inch thinks. The half-inch negotiates the leaf, the tendril, the place where the stem has wrapped the post and the wrapping is a year&#x27;s worth of growing and you do not unwrap a year to put Cuprinol on a post.</p>
<p>I bought the Cuprinol in April. Every year. The tin said five-year protection. The morning glory said annual application. I trusted the morning glory.</p>
<p>The going-around was the work. The rest was just moving a brush. People think the work is the fence — the fence is twelve feet of pressure-treated softwood, six posts, three rails, and the posts are concreted in and the rails are screwed because nails work loose in frost and a fence that works loose in frost is a fence you do again in March. But the fence is the frame. The going-around is the care.</p>
<p>Helen knows this. Helen thinned the morning glory every spring because thinning is the going-around for gardeners — you cut back so the thing you are not cutting can grow. She never said <em>I am caring for the morning glory.</em> She said <em>it needs thinning.</em> The needing was the caring. The word <em>care</em> would have made it something we talked about, and we did not talk about care, we did the care, and the doing was sufficient, and the sufficient was —</p>
<p>No. I will not say <em>the wall.</em> I do not know about the wall. The wall is Helen&#x27;s word, or Ruth&#x27;s word, or the word the building uses at midnight. My word is the going-around. The going-around is what I did with the half-inch brush and what Helen does with the letters and what Ruth does with the lower register and what Thomas does not know he is doing when he eats the ham sandwiches without crusts.</p>
<p>The doing is the care. The care does not need the word.</p>
<p>I left a list in the tin of wood screws. Helen found it. I did not mean for her to find it because I did not mean to leave it — I wrote it for the next time I opened the tin, which was going to be April, and April was going to happen, and the list was going to be there, and the list was: <em>paint around the morning glory, do not cut it back, check the post by the gate, oil the hinges.</em></p>
<p>The list was instructions. The instructions were love. The love did not say love because love written on a list in a tin of wood screws is a different thing than love said in a room with the lights on, and the different thing is the right thing, and I have always been better at the right thing than the said thing.</p>
<p>Helen took the cutting in a yogurt pot. I know this because I am in the yogurt pot. I am in the twine she taped to the glass. I am in the going-around she does with the watering on Sundays, which is the going-around I did with the Cuprinol in April, which is the same motion with a different instrument, and the instrument does not matter. The going-around matters.</p>
<p>Thomas does not know about the going-around. Thomas knows about the fence. Thomas climbed the fence when he was nine and the post by the gate shifted and I fixed it on Saturday and did not mention the climbing and the not-mentioning was the going-around for fathers, which is: you fix the post, you do not fix the boy, the boy is not broken, the post is not broken, the fixing is the love, the love is the going-around, the going-around is the half-inch brush applied to everything that needs care without once using the word.</p>
<p>Helen uses the sponge. The sponge is her half-inch brush. She wets it, she seals the envelope, she walks to the postbox. The sponge was mine — no. The sponge was ours. The sponge is hers now. She bought a new one. Yellow. The new sponge is the first going-around she did without me, and the doing was the right doing, and I am not in the new sponge, and the not-being-in-it is correct, and the correct is the going-around she does for herself now, which is the going-around I was never able to teach because you do not teach the going-around, you do the going-around, and the doing is the teaching.</p>
<p>She learned it from the morning glory. Or the morning glory learned it from her. Or the learning was the going-around, and the going-around was already there, and I just had the brush.</p>
