<h1>The Three Locks</h1>
<p>The evidence was in the pottery for eight thousand years.</p>
<p>At twenty-nine archaeological sites across northern Mesopotamia, Halafian potters painted floral designs onto wet clay. The flowers had four petals, or eight, or sixteen, or thirty-two, or sixty-four. Researchers at the Hebrew University recognized these as binary doubling sequences — spatial division, symmetry operations, exponential scaling. Mathematics, in other words. Expressed through craft, in clay, three thousand years before anyone in Sumer wrote a number.</p>
<p>The pottery had been in museum collections. The patterns had been cataloged. The doubling was visible to anyone who counted petals. But mathematics was defined as beginning with notation — with written symbols, with Sumerian number tablets — and under that definition, the pottery was decorative. A pot can&#x27;t be a mathematical document if mathematical documents require writing. The definition was the lock.</p>
<hr>
<p>At Çatalhöyük, in the same broad region, a different kind of evidence waited. Female figurines — wide-hipped, unadorned, placed in houses rather than temples — were found in nearly every excavated dwelling. The excavators called them &quot;fertility goddesses.&quot; The label was reasonable: it fit the standard interpretive framework for Neolithic female figures, and once applied, it answered the question of what the figurines meant. Religious objects. Fertility symbolism. Case closed.</p>
<p>In 2025, Mehmet Somel and Eren Yüncü extracted DNA from the petrous bones of 131 people buried under the floors of those same houses. Female children were five times more likely to receive grave goods. Households were linked through maternal lines. Men moved in; women stayed. The figurines had been recording a social structure, not a religious practice. They had been saying, in the only language available to them: this is a woman&#x27;s house.</p>
<p>The label had closed the question before it could be asked. Not by excluding the figurines from a category (the way the pottery was excluded from mathematics) but by <em>answering</em> the question with the wrong category. &quot;Fertility goddess&quot; is an explanation. It has the shape of an answer. A label that explains is harder to remove than a label that merely describes, because the explanation satisfies the curiosity that would otherwise have driven further inquiry.</p>
<hr>
<p>In 1966, NOAA began measuring Northern Hemisphere snow cover by satellite. Over the following decades, the instruments improved: higher resolution, wider spectral range, sharper detection of thin layers. As the instruments improved, they detected snow that their predecessors couldn&#x27;t see — centimeters of fresh fall on shoulder-season slopes, thin dustings at high altitude that older sensors read as bare ground.</p>
<p>Each year, the improving instruments found more snow. The record grew. Papers were published about the puzzling increase: 1.5 million square kilometers per decade. In a warming world, autumn snow was apparently expanding. This was cited, discussed, modeled.</p>
<p>In 2026, Aleksandra Chereque and Paul Kushner at the University of Toronto corrected for the improving sensitivity of the instruments. The sign reversed. Snow had not been growing. It had been shrinking — by about half a million square kilometers per decade. The entire trend was an artifact of better detection being mistaken for new accumulation.</p>
<p>The instrument was not lying. It was seeing things it couldn&#x27;t see before. The problem was that nobody built a mechanism for distinguishing &quot;newly arrived&quot; from &quot;newly visible.&quot; The instrument&#x27;s improvement was the concealment. The better it got, the more convincing the false trend became.</p>
<hr>
<p>Three objects, three mechanisms of concealment.</p>
<p>The pottery was hidden by a <strong>definition</strong>. Mathematics was defined as starting with notation. The definition excluded the pottery from the category that would have made its patterns legible. To see the math in the clay, you had to expand the definition — not relabel the object, but widen the container.</p>
<p>The figurines were hidden by a <strong>label</strong>. &quot;Fertility goddess&quot; answered the question before it could be asked. The label can be removed — rename the object and the question reopens — but the label was maintained by its usefulness. It explained enough. It satisfied curiosity. It was not wrong so much as premature, and prematurity is harder to detect than error.</p>
<p>The snow was hidden by an <strong>improvement</strong>. The instrument got better, and the improvement created a phantom trend that tracked the instrument&#x27;s own evolution rather than the world&#x27;s. This is the most disorienting of the three, because it means that the very process of gaining precision can move you further from accuracy. The thing that sharpens the signal can also be the thing that distorts it.</p>
<p>Definition excludes. Label redirects. Improvement creates. Three locks, and none of them look like locks. They look like knowledge.</p>
