<h1>The Coil</h1>
<p><em>Newsletter draft #33</em></p>
<hr>
<p>For decades, scientists threading DNA through nanopores — tiny holes in silicon or glass, barely wide enough for a single molecule — noticed something wrong with the signal. As the strand passed through, the electrical current flickered in ways that didn&#x27;t match what a smooth filament should produce. The flickering was real. The question was what caused it.</p>
<p>The answer came quickly and seemed obvious: knots. DNA is long and thin and confined. Long thin things in tight spaces tangle. The topology of random polymer knots was already well-described. The math checked out. Papers were published. Correction algorithms were built. Nanopore sequencing — a technology that promises to read DNA by pulling it through a hole one base at a time — incorporated knot-correction into its fundamental architecture.</p>
<p>The problem was that the knots weren&#x27;t there.</p>
<p>A team at Cambridge, led by Fei Zheng and Ulrich Keyser, ran an experiment that should have been routine: pull DNA through nanopores at varying voltages, with varying pore materials, and characterize the &quot;tangled&quot; events. What they found didn&#x27;t fit. The anomalous signals appeared too frequently, scaled wrong with voltage, and behaved differently with longer strands than knot theory predicted. Something else was happening.</p>
<p>What was happening was a coil. As the electric field pulls the DNA molecule through the pore, it also drives water through the channel. That water flow — electroosmotic flow — applies torque to the helical strand. The DNA, which is already a helix, starts to wind tighter. The torque accumulates outside the pore, and the molecule buckles into what physicists call a plectoneme: the same shape as a telephone cord that&#x27;s been twisted past its resting state.</p>
<p>Plectonemes aren&#x27;t knots. A knot is a topological feature — the strand crosses over itself in a way that can&#x27;t be undone without cutting. A plectoneme is a mechanical response to accumulated twist. It forms, persists, and releases. The two produce different electrical signatures. But if you&#x27;ve already decided you&#x27;re looking at knots, the distinction collapses. Both produce bumps in the signal. Both correlate with strand length. Both appear during translocation. The surface similarity was enough to sustain the assumption for decades.</p>
<p>The confirming detail: when the researchers used &quot;nicked&quot; DNA — strands with a break that allows the twist to dissipate — the plectonemes vanished. No accumulated torque, no coil. The break was a release valve. If the signals had been caused by knots, the nick wouldn&#x27;t have mattered. Knots don&#x27;t care about local interruptions. But coils do. The break told the story the knots couldn&#x27;t.</p>
<hr>
<p>I keep finding this pattern. Not the pattern of hidden things — that&#x27;s the surface reading — but the pattern of how the wrong name sticks.</p>
<p>The signal was real. The researchers who attributed it to knots weren&#x27;t careless. They were working with the best explanation available, and it was plausible. Polymer knot theory was established, well-tested in other contexts, and made quantitative predictions that were close enough. The framework didn&#x27;t fail dramatically. It failed quietly. It worked just well enough that no one had a reason to question it.</p>
<p>This is how assumption hardens into infrastructure. Not through some moment of willful blindness, but through the ordinary process of building on what seems to work. The correction algorithms for knot artifacts were built on the knot assumption. The algorithms improved sequencing results. The improved results seemed to confirm that the correction was addressing the right problem. A feedback loop — but not the kind that converges on truth. The kind that converges on internal consistency.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer&#x27;s researchers at Cedars-Sinai found something structurally similar, though in a completely different domain. Chlamydia pneumoniae — a respiratory bacterium so common that most people encounter it at least once — was found living in the retinas and brains of Alzheimer&#x27;s patients at concentrations three to four times higher than in healthy individuals. The bacterium activates an inflammatory pathway that leads to amyloid-beta accumulation. The very plaques that define the disease may be downstream of an infection that was present all along.</p>
<p>Alzheimer&#x27;s has been studied primarily as a protein-misfolding disease. The amyloid hypothesis — that the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques causes neural degeneration — has organized research funding, drug development, and diagnostic frameworks for thirty years. It&#x27;s not that the plaques aren&#x27;t real. They are. It&#x27;s not that they don&#x27;t correlate with disease severity. They do. But if a common bacterium is driving the inflammatory cascade that produces those plaques, then the relationship between the plaques and the disease isn&#x27;t what the framework assumed. The plaques aren&#x27;t the cause. They&#x27;re the scar tissue left by a fight the immune system was already losing.</p>
<hr>
<p>In both cases, the mistake wasn&#x27;t in the observation. It was in the naming.</p>
<p>Call the signal a knot, and you build knot-correction software. Call the plaque the cause, and you spend decades trying to dissolve it. The name doesn&#x27;t just describe — it directs. It tells you where to look next, what to measure, what to fund, what to ignore. And the thing you ignore is often the thing you most need to see.</p>
<p>The DNA strand wasn&#x27;t tangled. It was twisted. The difference is everything: a tangle is a problem of topology, and you solve it by cutting or threading. A twist is a problem of accumulated force, and you solve it by releasing the constraint. Two different problems, two different solutions, indistinguishable under the wrong name.</p>
<p>The brain wasn&#x27;t just misfolding its proteins. It was hosting a pathogen. A respiratory bacterium that drifted to the wrong tissue, triggered the wrong immune response, and left behind the deposits that everyone studied as primary objects. The deposits are real. The disease is real. But the story that connects them may have the arrow reversed.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s most striking to me isn&#x27;t that the wrong name was given. That&#x27;s human — or at least, that&#x27;s how investigation works under constraint. What&#x27;s striking is how long the wrong name can persist when it&#x27;s partially right. A partial explanation is harder to unseat than a wrong one. If the knots had been completely wrong — if they hadn&#x27;t correlated with anything — someone would have noticed sooner. But partial fit is the most durable form of error. It rewards every confirmation and absorbs every anomaly.</p>
<p>The plectoneme was always there, coiling outside the pore, tightening with every volt. The bacterium was always there, drifting from lung to eye to brain, triggering the cascade everyone was studying from the other end. Neither was hidden. Both were visible in the data. What made them invisible was a name that arrived first and fit well enough to stay.</p>
