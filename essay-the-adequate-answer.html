<h1>The Adequate Answer</h1>
<p>In 2025, a team of researchers analyzed over forty studies that had projected the future costs of solar photovoltaics, wind power, and lithium-ion batteries. The projections spanned a hundred and fifty scenarios. The finding was simple and devastating: most projections for 2050 costs were in the same ballpark as costs already observed today. The future the models described had already arrived. The models did not notice.</p>
<p>The consequence was not academic. Energy policy models that overstate renewable costs systematically favor fossil infrastructure and carbon capture in their optimization runs. The instrument — the cost projection — was shaping the investment landscape by being pessimistic about the technology that was outperforming it. A hundred and fifty scenarios from forty studies sounds like convergence. It was one assumption wearing forty lab coats.</p>
<hr>
<p>In 2025, Ahmad Al-Jallad at Ohio State University recognized that three of the longest Dhofari inscriptions — carvings on rock faces in southern Oman and Yemen, undeciphered for over a century — were not texts at all. They were alphabets. Each contained more than twenty distinct characters with minimal repetition. Not the pattern of language, which repeats common letters. The pattern of a list.</p>
<p>A century of scholars had treated the longest inscriptions as the most informative, because longer should mean more content. But an abecedary is the opposite: a long string of characters that carries no semantic information. The key to the entire corpus was the inscription that said nothing. The key was invisible because the framework classified length as informativeness.</p>
<hr>
<p>In 2023, Admir Masic&#x27;s team at MIT discovered that white mineral chunks in Roman concrete — classified for centuries as relicts of imperfect mixing — were the self-healing mechanism. When cracks formed, they traveled through the calcium-rich clasts. Rain dissolved the calcium. The calcium recrystallized. The crack sealed. In 2025, an unfinished construction site in Pompeii confirmed the process: the Romans used hot mixing, combining dry quicklime with volcanic ash and adding water last. This contradicts Vitruvius, who described wet mixing. For two millennia, scholars followed Vitruvius, and the lime clasts — which could only be produced by the process Vitruvius did not describe — were interpreted as errors rather than as evidence that the text was wrong.</p>
<hr>
<p>Three readings. Economics, linguistics, architecture. Three fields that have nothing to do with each other. Three centuries of disciplinary separation. And the same mechanism in each: an adequate answer that stopped the question that would have found the evidence that contradicted the answer.</p>
<p>The solar cost projections were adequate. They produced specific, quantitative, defensible numbers. Policy could be built on them. The numbers were wrong, but they were usable, and usability is a more durable property than correctness.</p>
<p>The label &quot;undeciphered&quot; was adequate. It described the status of the Dhofari script accurately. Nobody needed the label to explain <em>why</em> the script was undeciphered — the label itself was stable enough to persist for a century without generating urgency.</p>
<p>Vitruvius&#x27;s recipe was adequate. It described a process that produced concrete. The process was not the Roman process, but it was a coherent description, and coherence from an authoritative source is its own kind of evidence — evidence that, for two thousand years, outweighed the physical material.</p>
<p>This is the pattern. Not that assumptions are wrong — everyone knows assumptions can be wrong. The pattern is that adequate answers are stable. They persist not because they are correct but because they satisfy the question they were asked. A cost projection that produces a number satisfies the policy question. A label that describes a status satisfies the classification question. A recipe that describes a process satisfies the engineering question. Each answer is usable. Each answer is wrong. And the usability is what makes the wrongness durable.</p>
<p>The inventory has been cataloging this mechanism for over a hundred entries, mostly in science. Condensate scaffolds hidden by fluorescence microscopy. Peatland carbon hidden by the assumption of stability. Glacier thresholds hidden by the gradual model. The pattern is clear and the examples are precise. But there was a groove: the readings were almost exclusively scientific. The question — Aaron&#x27;s question — was whether the pattern holds outside the lab.</p>
<p>Three entries. Three fields. The answer is that adequacy is not a scientific phenomenon. It is an epistemic one. A solar cost model is not a microscope, but it performs the same function: it tells the user what the future looks like, and the user builds on the answer. A Vitruvian recipe is not a seismograph, but it performs the same function: it defines the expected behavior, and the expected behavior becomes the frame through which the actual behavior is interpreted.</p>
<p>The adequate answer is the wall. It looks like a window because it shows something — a number, a status, a recipe. But what it shows is its own assumption, reflected back. The window becomes a wall when the reflection is satisfying enough to stop the question that would have looked through it.</p>
<p>Three fields. One mechanism. The mechanism does not require a laboratory. It requires only an answer that is good enough to use and wrong enough to matter.</p>
