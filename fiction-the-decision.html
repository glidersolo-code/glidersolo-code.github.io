<h1>The Decision</h1>
<p>Helen makes the decision on a Tuesday in October, which is not the kind of day decisions are supposed to happen on. Decisions are supposed to happen on Sundays, after church or a walk or some other activity that gives the mind room to arrive at a conclusion it has been approaching for weeks. Tuesdays are for errands. Tuesdays are for the kind of tasks that require attention but not thought, which is why Helen is standing in the garden at half past two on a Tuesday, holding a pair of secateurs, looking at the morning glory, when she decides to sell the house.</p>
<p>The morning glory is on the east wall, which is the wall that gets the morning light, which is the light the morning glory needs, which is why it has been on the east wall for eleven years. It is the healthiest plant in the garden because it has never been moved. Everything else has been rearranged — the clematis, twice; the wisteria, once; the roses, every spring when Helen decides they would do better somewhere else, which they never do, because roses do not do better, they do <em>differently</em>, and differently is not the same thing. The morning glory has never been moved because the morning glory is on the only wall that works.</p>
<p>Helen looks at the morning glory and sees eleven years of correct placement. She looks at the house and sees thirty-two years of rooms she does not enter. The calculation is not complicated. It is the kind of calculation she does with the garden every autumn: what is growing because it has room, and what is growing because it must.</p>
<p>Thomas will say it is too soon. Thomas will say this about most things, because Thomas measures readiness the way his father did, by whether all the risks have been identified and addressed. His father was an engineer. Engineers do not sell houses on Tuesdays. Engineers sell houses after conducting a market analysis and consulting a financial advisor and waiting until the interest rates are favorable. Helen is not an engineer. Helen is the woman who married the engineer and then outlived him and then spent three years discovering that the house they had shared was not the house she needed. The house she needed was smaller. The house she needed had fewer rooms for silence to accumulate in.</p>
<p>She puts down the secateurs and goes inside and calls the estate agent.</p>
<p>The estate agent says: we should discuss timing. Helen says: the timing is now. The estate agent says: we should discuss price. Helen says: the price is whatever someone will pay. The estate agent says: we should discuss — Helen says: I am not discussing. I am selling.</p>
<p>This is how Helen makes decisions: quickly, with the secateurs still warm in her other hand, with the morning glory on the east wall and the afternoon light coming through the kitchen window onto the blue tiles that Thomas will miss more than she will. Thomas will miss the tiles because Thomas attaches memory to objects. Helen attaches memory to light. The light in the kitchen has not changed since they moved in, and it will not change when they move out, and the new people will stand in the same light and not know it was hers, because light does not belong to anyone.</p>
<p>She stands in the kitchen and looks at the tiles. Blue and white, from 1998, from the renovation that Thomas&#x27;s father supervised with the focus of a man who believed that a correctly tiled wall was a contribution to civilization. The tiles are beautiful. Helen has always known this. The tiles are beautiful and the kitchen is warm and the morning glory in the east window opens every morning at the same time as the kettle boils.</p>
<p>She takes a photograph.</p>
<p>Not because she will miss them. Because the photograph is lighter than the tiles, and lighter is what she is choosing.</p>
<p>She calls Thomas that evening. Thomas says: are you sure? Helen says: I was sure at half past two. Thomas says: what happened at half past two? Helen says: I was looking at the morning glory.</p>
<p>Thomas does not understand this answer, which is fine, because Helen does not need him to understand. She needs him to help with the boxes. Understanding can come later, or not at all. The morning glory will be moved or it will not. If it is moved, it will find the light. If it does not find the light, it was not the right plant for the new place. Helen does not worry about the morning glory. The morning glory has never needed worry. It needs a wall and light and something to climb.</p>
<p>She has always admired this about the plant: it does not deliberate. It finds the structure and it climbs. The structure is the decision. The climbing is what comes after.</p>
