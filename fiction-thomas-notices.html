<h1>Thomas Notices</h1>
<p>He noticed the lemon.</p>
<p>Not that it was there — the lemon was always there, on the plate beside the ham sandwiches, a wedge cut from a lemon that had been cut in half, the other half somewhere in the fridge or the bin, he did not know and had never asked. The lemon was for the tea. He did not take lemon in his tea. He had never taken lemon in his tea. The lemon was there anyway.</p>
<p>He noticed it the way you notice a crack in the pavement — not by deciding to look but by looking down at the wrong moment and seeing that the thing has been there, and the having-been-there is longer than the looking, and the looking is the moment you realize that the thing has been having-been-there for all the time you were not looking.</p>
<p>The lemon was for him. The lemon was offered every Saturday. He declined every Saturday. She offered every Saturday. The offering did not change. The declining did not change. The lemon did not change. The thing that changed was that today, in the chair by the window, with the blue cup half-full and the ham sandwiches eaten and the morning glory on the twine and the faint sound of something through the floor, he looked at the lemon and saw the offering.</p>
<p>Not the lemon — the offering. The lemon was fruit. The offering was the practice.</p>
<p>&quot;Mum.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How long have you been buying lemons?&quot;</p>
<p>She looked at him the way she looked at the morning glory when it reached a new height on the twine — not with surprise, because the growth was expected, but with the recognition that the expected thing had happened and the happening was the good thing.</p>
<p>&quot;Since you started coming on Saturdays.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t take lemon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The lemon is there in case you change your mind.&quot;</p>
<p>He looked at the lemon. The lemon was a wedge on a plate. The wedge was from a lemon that was bought on Friday, which was one day before Saturday, which was the day the lemon was for, which was the day he came, which was the reason the lemon was bought, which was the reason Friday had a lemon, which was the reason the week had a shape he did not know about until now.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>He did not know the shape. He knew the lemon. He knew the lemon was bought for him, was offered to him, was declined by him, was offered again, was there. The there-ness was the shape. But the shape was larger than the lemon. The shape was Friday and the lemon and before that Thursday and something about tea at four o&#x27;clock and before that Wednesday and Margaret and before that Tuesday and the shops and before that Monday and something through the floor that was happening right now, faintly, and had been happening every time he visited but he had not heard it as anything other than the building being a building.</p>
<p>&quot;Mum.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your week. What do you do all week?&quot;</p>
<p>She put down her cup. She looked at him. The looking was the looking she gave the morning glory when the morning glory reached the top of the twine — not when it arrived but when she knew it would arrive, which was earlier, which was when the growing was visible but the arrival was not yet, which was the moment between the reaching and the holding.</p>
<p>&quot;I water the morning glory on Sundays,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>She did not say the rest. She did not say Monday or Tuesday or Margaret or Ruth or the note on blue paper or the Sarabande through the floor or the crack in the pavement or the kettle and its different meanings at different times. She said the morning glory and Sunday, which was the first thing, which was the beginning.</p>
<p>He could have asked: and then what?</p>
<p>He did not ask.</p>
<p>He looked at the lemon. He looked at the morning glory. He looked at his mother, who was sitting in the chair by the wall with her cup and her quiet and the week inside the quiet like water inside a kettle, waiting for the element to heat it, waiting for the click, waiting for the pour.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll have the lemon,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>She did not smile. She did something with her face that was adjacent to a smile but more precise — a recognition, a noticing, a shift of the same kind that the morning glory&#x27;s tip makes between Monday and Tuesday, invisible unless you are looking, and she had been looking.</p>
<p>She put the lemon in his tea.</p>
<p>The tea changed.</p>
<p>Everything else stayed where it was.</p>
