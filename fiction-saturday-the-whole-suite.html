<h1>Saturday, the Whole Suite</h1>
<p>&quot;She played the whole Suite,&quot; Helen said.</p>
<p>Thomas was cutting the bread. The bread was from the bakery on the corner — the bakery that had been there when Michael was alive, the bakery that would be there when Michael was gone, the bakery that did not know it was part of a going-around because the bakery was the going-around. Saturday bread. Saturday knife. Saturday board.</p>
<p>&quot;The wolf tone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Everything.&quot;</p>
<p>Thomas put the knife down. Helen was at the window. The morning glory was on the fence — February morning glory, dormant, the vine a brown thread on the wire, the wire Michael&#x27;s wire, the fence Michael&#x27;s fence, the going-around Michael&#x27;s going-around applied to a boundary between two gardens.</p>
<p>&quot;Could you hear it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I could hear a wobble.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the second Bourrée?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know which Bourrée, Thomas. I don&#x27;t know the Bourrées. I know the Sarabande because the Sarabande is the one I hear every night and the hearing has made it mine. The Bourrées are new.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not new.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;New again. She stopped playing them weeks ago. She took them out. She was — I think she was protecting me.&quot;</p>
<p>Thomas sat down. Michael&#x27;s chair. The chair did not protest. The chair had not protested in years — the chair had accepted Thomas the way the kitchen had accepted Thomas, gradually, on Saturdays, one sitting at a time, the weight of the son replacing the weight of the father in the same place.</p>
<p>&quot;And the wobble?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The wobble was small. Four measures — I counted. Four measures of something that was not the Sarabande. Something rougher. Something that included the instrument.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The instrument?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The instrument is in its own sound,&quot; Helen said. &quot;That is what the wolf tone is. Ruth&#x27;s note said that. The frequency where the cello&#x27;s body vibrates with the string. The body is present in the sound it makes. The body admits it is a body.&quot;</p>
<p>Thomas looked at the bread. The bread was cut. Three slices. One for Helen. One for Thomas. One for the plate — the plate that was Michael&#x27;s plate, the third slice that was Michael&#x27;s slice, the going-around applied to a breakfast until the breakfast includes everyone who has ever eaten it.</p>
<p>&quot;The body admits it is a body,&quot; Thomas said.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The kitchen admits it is a kitchen.&quot;</p>
<p>Helen turned from the window. &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The wolf tone of this kitchen is the kettle. The wobble in the whistle. Michael used to stand by the stove and wait for it. You stand by the stove and wait for it. I sit in the chair and listen for it. The kettle admits it is a kettle. The whistle includes the wobble. The wobble includes Michael.&quot;</p>
<p>Helen did not say anything for a while.</p>
<p>&quot;Play the whole Suite,&quot; she said eventually. &quot;I said that. Play the whole Suite. The building will do the rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The instruction was right. The building did the rest. The building carried the wolf tone and the building reduced the wolf tone and the wolf tone arrived as a wobble and the wobble was — it was the Suite admitting it was being played by a person in a room through a floor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Suite admitting it was being played.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Suite admitting it included the player.&quot;</p>
<p>Thomas buttered the bread. The butter was cold. The butter was always cold on Saturday mornings because the butter lived in the back of the fridge and the back of the fridge was Michael&#x27;s arrangement — butter back, cheese middle, milk front. Thomas had not moved the butter. Helen had not moved the butter. The butter stayed where Michael put it. The going-around applied to a refrigerator.</p>
<p>&quot;I am the wolf tone,&quot; Thomas said.</p>
<p>Helen looked at him.</p>
<p>&quot;The frequency where your body vibrates with the string of the son. The wobble in the visit. The instrument admits it is an instrument — the kitchen admits the son is in the room and the son is not the husband and the not-being-the-husband is not a flaw. It is the wolf tone. It is the body present in its own sound.&quot;</p>
<p>Helen sat down. Not in Michael&#x27;s chair — in her chair, the chair by the window, the chair where the morning glory&#x27;s shadow fell in summer and would fall again in May and the falling was the going-around applied to a season.</p>
<p>&quot;The wolf tone is welcome,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;You said that too. In the note. To Ruth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am saying it to you.&quot;</p>
<p>Thomas put the bread on the plates. Three plates. He poured the tea. Two cups. He sat down. The kitchen was quiet. Downstairs, the cello was silent. The Suite had been played. The whole Suite. The wolf tone had come and gone and the building had carried it and the floor had thinned it and the silence after included everything — the Sarabande and the Bourrées and the wolf and the wobble and the bread and the butter and the kettle&#x27;s whistle and Michael&#x27;s chair and the morning glory dormant on the fence.</p>
<p>Everything was where it was.</p>
<p>The whole Suite. Including the wolf.</p>
