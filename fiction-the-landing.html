<h1>The Landing</h1>
<p>Ruth met Helen on the landing on a Wednesday.</p>
<p>Not for the first time — they had passed each other before. The landing was narrow. Ruth carried a cello case. Helen carried shopping. There had been nods. There had been the particular distance of people who share a building and do not share a life, which is: close enough to recognize the footsteps, far enough to forget the name.</p>
<p>But this was the first Wednesday after the note.</p>
<p>Helen was coming down. Ruth was coming up. The cello case was in Ruth&#x27;s right hand and the weight was on her left shoulder and the landing was too narrow for both of them and the note was too recent for either of them to pretend.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello,&quot; Helen said.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello,&quot; Ruth said.</p>
<p>They stood. The landing held them both. The landing was two meters by one meter, which was smaller than Helen&#x27;s kitchen but larger than the gap under the door. The landing was the space between the Sarabande and the listening — the space the floor occupied vertically, now occupied horizontally by two women who had spent two years separated by two hundred and fourteen millimeters of joist and plasterboard.</p>
<p>&quot;I should have written sooner,&quot; Helen said. She said it the way she said everything: as though the words had been in a queue and this particular set had waited patiently for their turn.</p>
<p>&quot;You shouldn&#x27;t have written at all,&quot; Ruth said. And then, because the words sounded wrong and the wrong was not what she meant: &quot;I mean — the Sarabande was already enough. The note was more than enough. The note changed the Sarabande.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hope not,&quot; Helen said.</p>
<p>&quot;Not the playing. The — knowing. Knowing someone hears it.&quot;</p>
<p>Helen nodded. The nod was small and complete, the way Helen&#x27;s notes were small and complete. &quot;I hear it every night,&quot; she said. &quot;The floor changes it. You know that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know that now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The floor takes the top off and leaves the bottom. The bottom is very beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>Ruth held the cello case tighter. The cello case was the shape of the thing she played every night for a woman she had never spoken to about the playing. The case was the silence around the instrument. The landing was the silence between the flats.</p>
<p>&quot;Thursday,&quot; Ruth said. &quot;The note said Thursday was especially good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thursday you played it twice.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I lost my place.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; Helen said. &quot;There was a silence. Eleven seconds or thereabouts. Then you started again. The second time was different.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Different how?&quot;</p>
<p>Helen thought about this. She thought about it the way she thought about the week — carefully, from the inside, without hurrying. &quot;The second time knew the first time had happened. The first time didn&#x27;t know the second time was coming. The second time carried both.&quot;</p>
<p>Ruth said nothing. Ruth said nothing because the nothing was the right thing to say and the right thing was what Ruth had learned from the Sarabande, which is: the silence between two phrases carries the weight of both.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m Helen,&quot; Helen said. &quot;Upstairs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; Ruth said. &quot;I&#x27;m Ruth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; Helen said. &quot;The Sarabande.&quot;</p>
<p>They stood on the landing for another moment. The building held them. The building held them the way it held the Sarabande and the silence and the note and the footsteps and the kettle and the morning glory&#x27;s weight on the twine taped to the glass. The building carried what it could carry. The landing was part of what it carried.</p>
<p>&quot;Same time tonight?&quot; Helen said. She said it with the particular lightness of someone who has been listening for two years and does not need the answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Same time every night,&quot; Ruth said.</p>
<p>&quot;Good,&quot; Helen said. One word. The word Margaret would have used. The word that, for Helen, was a complete sentence: subject, verb, object, the object being the Sarabande and the silence and the landing and the two years of not-meeting that had made this meeting possible.</p>
<p>Helen went down the stairs. Ruth went up. The landing was empty. The landing was the silence between two people who had just met for the first time after knowing each other for two years through a floor.</p>
<p>The floor carried them both.</p>
