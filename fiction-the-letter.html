<h1>The Letter</h1>
<p>The letter had been on the kitchen table for three days.</p>
<p>It was from his mother. He knew this because of the handwriting on the envelope — the careful, slightly leftward-leaning script that she had never changed in sixty years, even as her hands changed around it. The return address was the house he grew up in, which she still lived in, which he had not visited since October.</p>
<p>He had not opened it.</p>
<p>This was not avoidance. He was not afraid of what the letter said. He was fairly sure it said: I am well. The garden is doing something. The neighbor&#x27;s dog is doing something else. Come visit when you can. The letters always said this. They arrived every two weeks, in the same envelopes, with the same stamps, because his mother believed that email was for strangers and phone calls were for emergencies and letters were for the people you loved enough to inconvenience yourself for.</p>
<p>He had not opened it because the letter, sealed, was a better object than the letter would be, opened.</p>
<p>Sealed, it was the act of writing. The walk to the post office. The choosing of the stamp — she always chose, never took the first one offered. The addressing, with that careful script, each letter given its full shape, no shortcuts. The sealing, which she did with a wet sponge rather than her tongue because she had read somewhere in the 1970s that envelope glue was bad for you and had never revisited the question.</p>
<p>Opened, it would be information. Fine information. Good information. But information he already knew, because she was well, the garden was doing something, and the neighbor&#x27;s dog was doing something else.</p>
<p>On the fourth day he opened it.</p>
<p><em>Dear Thomas,</em></p>
<p><em>I am selling the house.</em></p>
<p>He sat down. Not because the news required sitting — he had a chair right there and would have sat in it anyway — but because his body made the decision a half-second before his mind caught up, the way bodies do when they are told something that the mind has not yet decided to believe.</p>
<p>The rest of the letter was practical. The roof needed work she couldn&#x27;t afford. The stairs were becoming difficult. Margaret next door had found a ground-floor flat near the shops. The real estate agent said the market was good. She had already signed something.</p>
<p>He read it twice. Then he looked at the envelope — the careful script, the chosen stamp, the sponge-sealed flap — and understood that the letter had been a better object sealed not because he had been savoring the ritual but because he had, without knowing it, been postponing this exact moment, the way you postpone a phone call that might be fine but might not, and you tell yourself you are busy, and you are busy, but that is not why you haven&#x27;t called.</p>
<p>He called her.</p>
<p>&quot;You got my letter,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Three days ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Four,&quot; she said. &quot;I know when it would have arrived, Thomas. I&#x27;ve been sending them for eleven years.&quot;</p>
<p>He laughed. She laughed. It was not the conversation he had expected, which was the first time in years that a conversation with his mother had surprised him, and the surprise itself was a kind of letter — something delivered that he hadn&#x27;t known was coming, from someone he thought he could predict.</p>
<p>&quot;Come see it before I sell it,&quot; she said. &quot;The garden is doing something.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he would.</p>
