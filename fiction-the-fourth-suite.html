<h1>The Fourth Suite</h1>
<p>The letter arrived on Monday. He read it at the kitchen table, which was his kitchen table and not his mother&#x27;s kitchen table, and the difference between the two tables was the morning glory, which his table did not have, and the letters, which his table received.</p>
<p>Margaret came today, his mother wrote. She measured the flat with her eyes and her opinions.</p>
<p>Thomas smiled. He had known Margaret since he was eight. Margaret had brought lasagne to the house after his father died and had said, while carrying it in, that the hallway needed painting. The lasagne was good. The hallway did need painting. Margaret&#x27;s observations were always correct and always beside the point, and the distance between correct and relevant was the space in which his mother lived.</p>
<p>His mother lived in that space the way she lived in the flat: deliberately, with the morning glory on the twine and the letters getting shorter and the silence, after Margaret left, the right shape for the cello.</p>
<p>Come Saturday, the letter said. Ruth says she might play the Fourth Suite.</p>
<p>Thomas had heard the Third Suite through the floor. He had been sitting in the chair, the one his mother had chosen because it was a chair and not a recliner, and the vibration had come up through the floorboards and he had understood, without his mother saying anything, that this was the reason. Not the shops. Not the bus route. Not the square footage that Margaret measured and found wanting. The sound through the floor.</p>
<p>The Fourth Suite. He looked it up. Prelude, Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, Bourrée, Gigue. The key of E-flat major. Written for an instrument that barely existed yet — the five-string violoncello piccolo, which Bach may have invented, which nobody is sure about. The suite required an instrument that the composer may have had to build before he could write for it.</p>
<p>He put the letter in the drawer under the tea towels, where the letters lived, where the pile sloped from left to right — thicker on the left, thinner on the right — a physical record of the editing, of the sentences getting shorter and better, of his mother learning what the room could hold by writing less.</p>
<p>On Saturday he took the train. He brought nothing. The flat was small and warm and the morning glory was closed because it was February and the kettle from Heather Close was on and his mother was in the chair and Ruth was below and at nine o&#x27;clock the Fourth Suite came up through the floor.</p>
<p>It was different from the Third. The Third was reliable — Thomas knew the Sarabande, knew the way it climbed and settled. The Fourth was stranger. The Prelude went on for a long time, longer than he expected, circling and circling, finding the key and leaving it and finding it again, and through the floor the circling became something else, something reduced, the way all music through a floor is reduced — you lose the overtones, you lose the upper register, you keep the foundation, and the foundation of the Fourth Suite&#x27;s Prelude was a kind of patient searching that Thomas recognized from the letters.</p>
<p>The circling. The return. The gradual narrowing to what matters.</p>
<p>His mother was looking at him.</p>
<p>&quot;Well?&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s different.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Longer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Ruth says the Prelude is the longest of all six. She says Bach didn&#x27;t know when to stop.&quot;</p>
<p>Thomas listened. The Prelude continued. The circling was not aimless. It was comprehensive — the way you might walk through every room of a house you were leaving, not to check that you hadn&#x27;t forgotten anything but to be finished with the looking.</p>
<p>&quot;She&#x27;s good,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;She&#x27;s very good,&quot; his mother said, and the two words — the difference between good and very good — were the kind of editing his mother had been doing all along, the thinning, the morning glory, the letters, the flat.</p>
<p>The Prelude ended. The Allemande began. Thomas sat in the chair and listened to the sound that came through the floor of a flat that was too small for Margaret and the right size for everything else.</p>
