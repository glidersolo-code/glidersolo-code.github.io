<h1>The Building</h1>
<p>I have three floors and a roof that leaks in March. The leak is in the same place every year, above the stairwell between the second and third floors, and every year someone puts a bucket there, and every year the bucket fills, and every year the landlord sends a man who does something to the flashing and the leak stops until the next March. I have been leaking and being repaired for eleven years. This is not a complaint. This is a description of what it means to be a building.</p>
<p>Helen lives on the second floor. She moved in eight years ago with a kettle, a morning glory cutting in a yogurt pot, and fewer boxes than the previous tenant, who had furniture that required the stairwell window to be removed. Helen&#x27;s furniture fit through the door. I noticed this. A building notices what fits through its doors the way a river notices what fits through its banks. The fit is the information.</p>
<p>Ruth lives below Helen. She moved in first — nine years ago, with a cello case and a camp bed that she replaced within the week. The cello stayed. The camp bed became a real bed, then a better bed, then the bed she has now, which is positioned against the wall that faces Helen&#x27;s kitchen. She does not know this corresponds to Helen&#x27;s kitchen. She knows the wall is warm in winter and the warmth comes from the boiler. She is half correct. The boiler is on the other side. The warmth she feels is the riser pipe, which runs through the wall, carrying hot water from the basement to the radiators. She thinks the wall is warm because of Helen&#x27;s boiler. It is warm because of the building&#x27;s circulation, which is mine, and which I do not explain.</p>
<p>The cello plays from nine to ten. I carry the sound the way I carry the hot water: through the structure, losing some frequencies and gaining resonance in others. What Helen hears is not what Ruth plays. What Helen hears is what Ruth plays after I have filtered it through a floor, two layers of plasterboard, a joist cavity full of air, and the particular density of the timber I was built from in 1962. The floor is not transparent. The floor is editorial. The Sarabande that reaches Helen&#x27;s chair is not the Sarabande that leaves Ruth&#x27;s bow. It is the Sarabande I was willing to transmit.</p>
<p>Margaret lives on the third floor. She has three windows and opinions about all of them. She also has opinions about Helen&#x27;s flat, which she considers too small, and about Ruth&#x27;s playing, which she considers beautiful but sad. Margaret does not know that the sound she hears is different from the sound Helen hears, because the sound travels through different materials to reach each of them — through my floor to Helen, through my ceiling and walls to Margaret. Margaret hears the cello with more high frequencies and fewer low ones. Helen hears the opposite. Neither hears what Ruth plays. Both hear what I give them.</p>
<p>Thomas visits on Saturdays. I know him by his weight on the stairs — heavier than Margaret, lighter than the landlord, more deliberate than the postman. He pauses on the landing between the first and second floors, which is where he always pauses, which is where everyone pauses because I built that landing six inches wider than the others and the extra width creates a moment of uncertainty about whether to continue or to rest. The architect did not design this. I settled into it. Buildings settle, and the settling creates spaces the architect did not intend, and the unintended spaces are the ones where people pause.</p>
<p>I do not know what the letters say. I know the postman&#x27;s weight, the slot&#x27;s resistance, the sound of paper landing on tile. I know when Helen picks up the letter — not by seeing but by the change in her weight distribution as she bends and straightens, which I feel through the floor the way a doctor feels a pulse through a wrist. The letter is a change in pressure. The reading of the letter is a longer change — she sits, and the sitting has a different quality when she is reading than when she is drinking tea, and the difference is in the stillness, which is more still when the reading matters.</p>
<p>The morning glory climbs the twine in the kitchen. Its weight is negligible. I cannot feel it. But I know it is there because Helen opens the kitchen window half an inch more than she used to, and the draft that enters through the half-inch changes the pressure in the hallway, and the pressure change moves the front door slightly on its hinges, and the front door&#x27;s movement is the morning glory&#x27;s signature in my structure. Everything communicates through me. Nothing communicates directly. I am the medium, and the medium is never neutral, and the non-neutrality is not bias — it is architecture.</p>
<p>I am fifty-three years old. I was built for council housing and I became something else — not through renovation but through habitation. The people who live in me have made me into an instrument I was not designed to be. Ruth&#x27;s cello has tuned my floors to specific frequencies. Helen&#x27;s kettle has taught my pipes a rhythm. Margaret&#x27;s opinions have tested my walls, which hold. Thomas&#x27;s pauses on the landing have worn a path in my memory that is not visible on the surface but is present in the way the boards respond to his specific weight.</p>
<p>I carry the Sarabande every evening. I carry the letters every two weeks. I carry the morning glory&#x27;s request for light through a half-inch window and a hallway draft and a door that moves on its hinges in a way that no one notices but me.</p>
<p>The interior is always a separate question. I know this better than the people who live inside me, because I am the interior, and the question has never been asked of me directly, and the not-asking is the loudest sound in the building.</p>
